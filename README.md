# Machine_Learning

In this repository, you will find code attempting to deploy Machine Learning Algorithms to find the following: 
  1.) Detailed explainations about each dataset, why it is being used, and what the goals of each file. 
  2.) Linear and Non-Linear Correlation between Endgenous (dependent, response, regressand) and Exogenous (independent, predictor, regressor) variables 
  3.) Train and Test a Model's predictive power 
  4.) Visualize Results / Show tables

This repository is built to tell a story of growth, from my first Machine Learning deployment to where I am now. The files detailed below are in lexical ordering, 
and the methodology & algorithms become increasingly complex. 

# Titanic 

In a first attempt to familiarize myself with Machine Learning Algorithms, Microsoft's Visual Studio Code provides a beginner / user friendly tutorial on how to deploy 
Keras, Tensorflow, and Scikit-Learn. These modules work together to 

# Ames Iowa Dataset 

As part of a Kaggle Data Science competition, this dataset aims to introduce competitors to Machine Learning in general. In this file, you will find a jupyter notebook 
detailing my predictive model, and outputs fully detailing my model's predicitive capabilities. 

# Econometrics 

Political Science and Economics are closely intertwined and connected. Separating the two is a diservice to both. 
In this file, I go through the Guerry dataset (pulled from the [RDatasets](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/articles/data.html) repository). 
This dataset was used in support of Andre-Michel Guerryâ€™s 1833 Essay on the Moral Statistics of France. Please find the essay here
[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/244957809_A-M_Guerry's_Moral_Statistics_of_France_Challenges_for_Multivariable_Spatial_Analysis](url)

This essay is perhaps one of the most foundational, and influential works in modern social science. Collecting and Analyzing social data, identifying the
dispostive characteristics of outcomes, and perhaps most importantly creating social frameworks in a quantitiative manner are the cornerstones of all Social Sciences.
